Gather is a locally owned business located on Walnut Ave. As soon as customers walk in they are welcomed by a plethora of handmade products such as jewelry, clothes, toys, bath and body products, and more. Gather takes pride in fostering the creativity of others. This boutique sells the handmade products of 200+ independent artists. Once a month Gather hosts a craft night to encourage the community so that everyone can try their hand at creating their own art.
