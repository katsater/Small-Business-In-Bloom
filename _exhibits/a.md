BuffaLouie’s is a restaurant full of Hoosier pride. Everywhere you look this restaurant is decked out in IU memorabilia. As one of the top ten wing joints in the country, customers keep coming back for more. BuffaLouie’s was opened in 1984 by an IU-Bloomington student and they have been serving their family’s wing recipes ever since. It is a great place on Indiana Ave to hang out with friends and family, and watch an IU basketball or football game.
