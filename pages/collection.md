The photos for this project were collected from various small or local Bloomington businesses. Sydney collected some photos from various restaurants including BuffaLouie’s, Cup & Kettle Tea, and Soma Coffee House and Juice Bar. Madison went out at a later date to collect more photos of small businesses and to redo some of the original photos. She took new photos of BuffaLouie’s and Cup & Kettle Tea, and got new photos of Landlocked Music, Gather, and Lola & Co.
