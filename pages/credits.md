This project was completed by Sydney Geis (producer), Madison Peckinpaugh (writer), and Kathy Sater (technologist). As the producer Sydney was responsible for putting together the project proposal at the beginning of the project. As the writer Madison worked on putting together the collaboration memo throughout the semester. Everyday she added, in detail, any progress that the group made toward finishing the project. Madison and Sydney worked together to collect photos of small businesses for the project. As the technologist Kathy worked toward putting the Wax site together through GitHub. Additionally, Kathy put together the metadata record, a spreadsheet that exhibits all of the photos used in the project. This project was put together for the CMLT-C 151: Introduction to Popular Culture class. The goal of this project is to share with a broader audience the unique sense of community that is present in Bloomington thanks to the plethora of small businesses. This project was put together to convey the importance of small businesses and to show what they bring to the Bloomington community. The images and information provided on this project are meant to be shared in a public domain to convey how unique downtown Bloomington truly is.
