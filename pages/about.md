**What Small Businesses Mean to Us**   
	There are so many aspects of Bloomington that make it a unique community. From the IU-Bloomington campus and its rowdy basketball games to Lake Monroe and the well known Kirkwood Ave, there is no lack of individuality in this southern Indiana city. There is one aspect that contributes greatly to Bloomingtonâ€™s welcoming community: small and locally owned businesses. 
	There are a plethora of these small businesses in Bloomington. There are a significant amount of places to shop, specifically on Kirkwood Ave and Walnut Ave. Additionally, many students establish their own small businesses during their time on campus. At various school sanctioned events, students are given the opportunity to sell their own art, products, clothes, etc. While walking the streets of downtown Bloomington you will not be disappointed by the variety of shops and boutiques where you can find anything you may need: vinyls, clothes, home decor, accessories, and more. 
	This project is significant because it allows us to give our perspective on a small part of the community and its contribution towards how unique the Bloomington environment is. Not only are these shops and restaurants one-of-a-kind, but they contribute to Bloomington in other ways as well. They provide job opportunities and create competition in the business industry, which leads to overall improvement in the products that consumers are buying. The general importance of small businesses is why we decided to focus our project on them and bring more awareness to the small business community of Bloomington.
