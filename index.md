This project highlights six local businesses in Bloomington. Downtown Bloomington possesses a unique atmosphere with many small and locally owned businesses that help to establish a friendly and unique environment. When walking down Kirkwood Ave and Walnut Ave there is no lack of small businesses to shop  or grab a bite to eat at. The Sample Gates are an IU-Bloomington campus staple that look out over Kirkwood Ave. The Sample Gates represent the individuality that Bloomington possesses, an environment that would not be the same without the contribution of small businesses.
